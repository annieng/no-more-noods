# No-More-Noods

An arcade style noodle-themed game built using React and Web APIs.

In a world taken over by flying noods, what can you do?
Dodge! Dodge! Dodge!
How long can you survive?

Stop Sending Noods was created with Eugene Yu and Bruna Garcias for a 1-Day Hackathon.

## My roles include the following:
+ all frontend work
+ ui/ux design of game
+ game state management and user/gameplay flow
+ ui considerations
+ gameplay animations
